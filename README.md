# Graph and Node Classification

This repository contains Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) implementations for graph classification and node classification. It is part of Class: Deep Learning on Graphs, Fall 2023, at the University at Buffalo.

### Features

- **Graph Classification**: Uses the MUTAG dataset (or any TUDataset-compatible dataset).
- **Node Classification**: Uses the CORA dataset (or any Planetoid-compatible dataset).
- **Visualization**: Includes ROC curves, confusion matrices, and t-SNE embeddings.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/graph-node-classification.git
   cd graph-node-classification
